**Introduction:**ImagePy is an image processing software developed by python, supporting bmp, rgb, png and other commonly used image formats. It can handle grayscale images and multi-channel (color) images, support image stack (sequence) operation, support a variety of selection operations (point, line, surface, multi-line, multi-face, hollow polygon), carry out a variety of commonly used mathematical operations, commonly used filter operation, image measurement, as well as pixel statistics. It can carry on dem surface reconstruction and three-dimensional reconstruction of image sequence. And the framework is based on python development. The image data is represented by numpy. And thus it can easily access scikit-image, opencv, itk, mayavi and other third-party mature image processing library.
